# The suites fall into two groups. Six score the emulator against console
# captures and need a checkout to compare against:
#
#   PS2AUTOTESTS=/path/to/ps2autotests   (ee, fpu, iop, mmi, vif, vu)
#   PS1TESTS=/path/to/ps1-tests          (iop: the GTE and MDEC oracles)
#
#     git clone https://github.com/unknownbrackets/ps2autotests
#     git clone https://github.com/JaCzekanski/ps1-tests
#
# Without those the capture-backed suites skip rather than fail, so this
# is still worth running with neither set -- the rest do not need them.
#
# SANITIZER is passed through, so
#
#   SANITIZER=undefined sh tests/run-all.sh
#
# builds everything with UBSan. Do a clean build between sanitizers with
# different define sets rather than reusing objects.
#
# Exits non-zero if any suite does, and says which.
